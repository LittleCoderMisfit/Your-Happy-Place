        <h3>IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN EIGHT, THAT'S OKAY, GREAT EVEN!!!! </h3>
        <p>I used my to get through a very tough time. I felt like not being here. I remembered that I had things that made me feel better. I cheered myself up and didn't feel as depressed about life. This is why it's important to remember what makes you feel good about yourself. This is another reason I made this website. I needed to make myself feel better about the guys who were being jerks.</p>
